## Setup

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

## Develop

Work on the application in local development.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Build

Export a static build.

```shell
npm run build
```

The build outputs the static site to the `build` directory.

## Customize

Update `src/app.html` with your title and social preview tags. Replace the social preview image `static/preview.png` with a preview image for your app.

Themes can be customized in `tailwind.config.cjs`. Update the `dark` and `light` themes with your colors and styles. See the [daisyUI themes guide](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) for more information.

Knobs can be customized and replaced with knobs from the [WebKnobMan gallery](https://www.g200kg.com/en/webknobman/gallery.php). You may need to adjust the styles and the size of the `webaudio-param` in `src/components/controls/Knob.svelte` to match your knob. The default [unipolar knob](https://www.g200kg.com/en/webknobman/index.html?f=ST_knob_HarmonicWhite_37x37_128f.knob&n=1806) and [bipolar knob](https://www.g200kg.com/en/webknobman/index.html?f=ST_knob_HarmonicWhitePan_37x37_127f.knob&n=1807) can be themed in the WebKnobMan editor.

## Publish

The built site publishes with the [Fission CLI](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli) and the [Fission GH publish action](https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action). Publishing from the command line is configured in [fission.yaml](fission.yaml), and the GitHub publish action is configured in [publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml).

To setup publishing with the Fission CLI:

1. [Install the CLI](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation)
2. Run `fission setup` to make a Fission account
3. Run `npm run build` to build the app
4. Delete `fission.yaml`
5. Run `fission app register` to register a new Fission app (accept the `./build` directory suggestion for your build directory)
6. Run `fission app publish` to publish your app to the web

After publishing, your app will be available online at the domain assigned by the register command.

To set up the GitHub publish action:

1. Reigster the app with the CLI
2. Export your machine key with `base64 ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519`
3. Add your machine key as a GH Repository secret named `FISSION_MACHINE_KEY`
4. Update the `publish.yml` with the name of your registered app

See the [Fission Guide](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation) and the publish action README for more details.
